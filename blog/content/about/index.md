I'm Sylvain, a Cloud architect currently working at [Artifakt](https://artifakt.com), 
a French based PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service). My day to day work mainly involves
developing/maintaining Kubernetes controllers, Terraform recipes, NodeJS applications...

By night, I'm a big fan of Virtual Reality and video games. So I spend most of my free 
time with either my family, or working on something related to VR. You can find more 
about my current works in the [Projects section](/projects).

I'm kind of missing the really community part of the web, where everyone has his own 
website, iirc chat rooms, and mailing lists (notifications should be banned, unless you 
search and decide to subscribe to one like a RSS feed. That's why you won't find any kind 
of notifications here). So, I decided to make this website for everything I want to share. 
It will mostly be my thoughts and learnings from my projects, but it can also be my thoughts 
on movies/games/books, or opinions on various subjects (nothing political or religious, since 
I don't care about those subjects).

Note that this website is _very_ personal, so I might express myself with words or sentences 
that aren't suited for professional environment (I might swear or use particular metaphors...), 
don't be afraid, I will always be respectful anyway ;)
