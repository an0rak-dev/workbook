subtitle: 'Or : How to do 3D when I barely draw stickmen'
---

Have you ever been amazed by the beauty of the recent productions ? Whether it be in videogames
or in movies. The realism of the scene, it makes really feel like the worlds we see are real. 
3D graphism opens up an infinite universe of creation and discovery.

The problem is how does 3d graphism works ? How do we draw something which gives us the impression
of space when we only have one flat screen in front of us ?

Personally, the last time I tried to draw something... well... I'll let you judge...

Not glorious isn't it ?

But at least you can't be worse than me, and I managed to create something in 3D, so you can too ! 

Unfortunately, like in every new field, when you want to achieve your goal, you have to learn how
it works first.



## The Theory

Your computer works using chips, and mainly two different chips : the CPU and the GPU.

The **Central Processing Unit** (CPU) is basically the brain of you computer, it's that chip which
does most of the task processing. A CPU contains a lot of components in it (yep, the engineers working
on chipsets are really genius to make this inside a square _that_ small) : the ALU, the Central Unit, 
the MMU, the AGU... I'll not detail them all here, this topic needs its own post (_maybe I will one day_
ðŸ¤”), but like a brain it's really complex and capable of doing a lot of operations ! When you read that 
a CPU can go `up to 3.2GHz`, it means that a CPU do 3.2billion cycles per seconds, and thus can do 
3.2billion of operations per seconds.
