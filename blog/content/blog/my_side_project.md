I'm someone which is deeply curious about everything. If you ask people who
knows me since childhood, they'll tell you that the answer _Because._ is 
something that always drive me mad. 
Also, I hate being bored, there's so much things to do in this world, so 
much thing to learn that being bored is just a waste of time and resources.

Of course I work in my day life, and I'm a father too so my brain is quite 
busy, but there's time when it miss the fuel. That's why I decided to launch 
a side project in parallel, but I'll need an idea.

## The Idea

First, I need an idea. I wanted something big, something complicated and which
will have no link to my day to day work. Why ? Because I want to use it to 
learn new things, with a new angle, not be confined in one area. So I need 
something out of the Web development or Cloud development world.

Video games have always been part of my life since... like forever. I've 
played my first games on a brand new Playstation 1, and now I have like enough
video games in my library to play for 3 life times. I like the way they allow
us to have several lives, to live adventures.

Then someday I found the book Ready Player One by Ernest Cline at a second hand
library, and damn that I love this story, the fact that using Virtual Reality 
we may be able to actually _experiment_ those worlds. That our imagination will
be the only limit and the technology will allow us to create as many universe as 
there's star in the sky.

I know it's just a book (and a dystopian one), but the virtual world (and I'll
never called it the meta-shit thing) and its possibility make something pops in 
my head. Since this very first moment, I decided to specialized in Virtual Reality,
I do not want to wait for it to be good, I want to be _part of it_.

and experience the least.](/blogposts/my_side_project/read.jpg)

We have the general idea : something realated to the Virtual Reality. If I really
need a complex project, I may choose to create my own Game, and since I'm eager to
learn why just stopping to a Game, why not creating my own _GameEngine_ ? I know 
that there's a lot of good game engines out there, like Unity, and UnrealEngine, 
and those engine will always be more advanced that what I can do. But those engines
are _generic_, I want something dedicated, which consider VR as a first citizen.
And most importantly : I want to learn how a game engine works.

It's decided : **I'll create a Game Engine for VR.**
